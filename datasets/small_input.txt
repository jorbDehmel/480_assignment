According to the Handbook of Texas, the community was
established in 1905 and named for W. M. Sager, the townsite
donor. It was a shipping point for locally grown agricultural
products such as cotton, cattle, and poultry on the newly
constructed Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway.[2] Beginning
in 1909, the Stamford and Northwestern Railway, stretching from
Stamford to Spur, also provided rail service.[3] Fires in 1917
and 1926 caused extensive property damage, and the town's bank,
organized in 1908, failed in 1931.[2]
