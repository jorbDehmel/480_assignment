# CSCI 480 Assignment - Sorting Algorithms performance tests
This is a little program creating for testing the performance of different sorting algorithms.
It is a group project for CSCI 480 class (Algorithms: Design and Analysis).

# How to use it?
You can use the following command to compile the program and to create the writeup.pdf file, that contains information about the different sorting algorithms:
```bash
make all
```

Then you can use the following command, to run the program, input being the name of an input text, used by string-based sorting algorithms, and output, being the name of an output text location, where the performances of the sorting algorithms will be printed.
```bash
./main.out <input> <output>
```
